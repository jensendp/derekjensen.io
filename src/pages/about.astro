        My Journey
      </h2>
      <div class="prose max-w-none">
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          My path into software development wasn't a straight line. Like many
          developers, I started tinkering with code out of curiosity—building
          small projects, breaking things, and learning from every mistake along
          the way.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of
          projects, from web applications to mobile apps. Each experience taught
          me something new about building software that people actually want to
          use.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
          Today, I specialize in mobile development, with a particular focus on
          React Native. There's something deeply satisfying about building apps
          that people carry in their pockets and use every day.

      <div class="prose max-w-none mb-8">
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I started my career working primarily with web
          technologies—JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the ever-evolving ecosystem of
          frontend frameworks. This foundation proved invaluable when I
          transitioned to mobile development.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">
          React Native was a game-changer for me. It combined my love for React
          with the ability to build truly native mobile experiences. Since then,
          I've been deep in the mobile world, learning the nuances of iOS and
          Android platforms while leveraging the power of cross-platform
          development.
