A complete modern redesign of Poise Dance Center's website, transforming their Wix-based site into a fast, clean, and accessible Astro application.

## Key Improvements

- **Values-focused messaging** - Highlighting inclusivity, positivity, and confidence
- **Fast performance** - Astro's static generation for instant page loads

## Original Site Challenges

The original Wix site was JavaScript-heavy and harder to maintain. This redesign provides a cleaner, more maintainable solution that better showcases the studio's mission and offerings.
